          There is three options for the user to pick in the game all in pink text, one saying play, the one below that says credits and the bottom one says quit. The user clicks on credits and the text changes to a heading saying credits
          and text below it showing the people who helped create the game in different parts. Those parts are Art, Coding and Exterior. At the bottom it says back and the user clicks on it. The user then hovers over the play tab and clicks it.
          The screen changes to the street fighter style game with a knight on the left side and a bone looking wizard on the right side. At the top of both charaters there is their health bars and at the top middle there is a timer showing how long
          there is to fight. The user shows the charaters moving left and right and then shows their fighting animations. The Knight has a sword swing and a shield bash, while the wizard has a grey fire ball spin and a ranged fire ball attack.
          While the user are doing these attacks the health bars of the charaters go down. Eventually the knights health reaches zero and the knights body turns purple and then evaporates only leaving his head and sword on the ground. The wizard moves
          around a little bit and then the screen goes back to the menu screen and the video ends." controls muted>
