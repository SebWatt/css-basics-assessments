        <h2>My Journey through Video games</h1>
        <p>
          The first time I ever played a video game was in 2009 on the xbox 360.
          The game was The Beatles Rock Band </br> and it was a new experience that i loved.
          The second Game I ever played was Mario Kart Wii and I fell in love immediately. </br> 
          The game was exciting and really fun and at that moment I knew I wanted to have a job in the gaming industry. </br>
          A little more then a decade passed by and I learned a lot about video games and how to play them. I was nearing </br> 
          highschool and I had no clear thought of what classes I wanted to take. One day in mid january there was a little presentation </br>
          for the grade 8s about a technology school called PTEC or Pembina Trails Early College. It was a school about coding, problem solving </br>
          and making video games! I was super excited and when they annouced that they were doing a camp to check out what the school was like. </br>
          I signed up as fast as I could to have the chance of getting into the school. It was in early April when I found out I got in! </br> 
          I was super excited and was super pumped to start learning how to code and make video games because I wanted to do that since I </br> 
          was little. Last year I learned a lot at PTEC and I learned a lot about C#, Unity, blender and lots of other stuff. </br> 
          Currently I am in grade 10 learning a ton of new concepts, coding practices and problem solving, and I can't wait to keep </br> 
          on learning for the future.
