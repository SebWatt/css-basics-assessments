          <h2>My Journey through Video games</h1>
          <p>
            The first time I ever played a video game was in 2009 on the xbox 360.
            The game was The Beatles Rock Band, and it was a new experience that I loved.
            The second </br>game I ever played was Mario Kart Wii, and I fell in love immediately. 
            The game was exciting and really fun, it was then that I knew I wanted to have a job in the gaming </br>industry. 
            A little more than a decade passed by and I learned a lot about video games and how to play them. I was nearing 
            highschool and I had no clear thought of what </br>classes I wanted to take. One day in mid january there was a presentation
            for the grade 8s about a technology school called PTEC or Pembina Trails Early College.</br> It was a school about coding, problem solving 
            and making video games! I was super excited, and when they announced that they were doing a camp to show what </br>the school was like, 
            I signed up as fast as I could. I wanted to have the chance of getting into the school. It was in early April when I found out I got in! 
            I was super excited </br>and was pumped to start learning how to code and make video games because I had wanted to do that since I 
            was little. Last year I learned a lot at PTEC and I learned a </br>lot about C#, Unity, Blender and lots of other stuff.
            Currently, I am in grade 10 and learning a ton of new concepts, coding practices and problem solving, and I can't wait </br>to keep 
            on learning for the future.

          <p>I have been to Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, and I have also been to Europe.   
          The places in </br>Europe I have seen are Ireland, England, Scotland, France and Spain.  
          I have also traveled inside of Canada.</br> I have gone to Bitish Columbia a couple of times to go to Radium Hot Springs.
          I have been to Edmonton and </br>Calgary to visit family, and I have been to Toronto once for a wedding.</p>
