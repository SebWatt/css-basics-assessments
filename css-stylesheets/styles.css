  So I chose the color blue to represent trust and imaginativity. I think that having trust in a website is important to a client so that they know that i'm honest and 
  hard working. I think having imaginativity in a website is smart because I personnally think that I create lots of ideas that I want to complete in the future and the present.

  This scrolls down with the website while also spacing out the content below it, its z index will be 5 to be infront of every thing at the top.

  This is what it shows before the transition shows starts. It works like this because the transform is used for the X index which is set to 0 when you are not hoving over it
